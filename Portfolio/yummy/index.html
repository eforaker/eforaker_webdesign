    <p>All images and text in the magazines are AI-generated, using a model trained on a generation&#8217;s media consumption and synthesizing an imaginary world set in the realities of the early 2000s.</p>

      <img src="../images/pool_period.png"> 

<p>Fashion spreads, photographs of teen heartthrobs, and dogmatic advice columns reflect the value systems promoted through media culture in the early aughts, reproduced perhaps as readily and uncritically by an AI model as they were consumed by young readers at the time.</p> 

      <img src="../images/boys_gif.gif"> 
            

<p>Brightly colored headlines, advertisements for beauty products, diet and exercise tips, and a homogenous array of teen faces fill magazine covers and interior pages in a context that is both dated and yet still reflective of much of today&#8217;s media culture.</p>

      <img src="../images/sierra_june_1.png">          

<p>Targeted specifically to young women, these pages recall and reinforce a shaping of ideas about diet culture, desire, and self-presentation, while also underlining the inherently sexist, fatphobic, and racist themes present throughout.</p>
