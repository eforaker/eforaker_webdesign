      <h1><span class="serifitalic">The Artists’ Broadsheet</span></h1>
      <p>Web Design, 2021</p>
      <p>Created by Adrian CN Berry and Hayley Janes and funded by The University of Toronto Student Engagement Award. <span class="serifitalic">The Artists’ Broadsheet</span>  is a <a target="blank" href="https://theartistsbroadsheet.com/">digital publication</a> in the form of a grocery coupon broadsheet populated with virtual coupons that imagine a sustainable, thriving post-pandemic reality for artists and cultural workers. The form of a grocery store coupon broadsheet is intended to play with the absurdity of taking what artists and cultural workers offer to society and confining it to a standardized, narrowly-defined box. Each coupon contains information about the piece of art it depicts as well as the artist who has submitted said art piece to the project.</p> 
<p> <!-- The graphic design of the broadsheet is both familiar and absurdist. The header graphic references the chaotic aesthetics found on coupon broadsheets and collages everyday items with moving scissor gifs. The individual art piece coupons have standardized formatting so that they are infinitely replicable as the project/website grows. Custom open and closed (on hover) scissor cursors mimic the cutting out of coupons.  -->Web development and additional design by Sarah Boo.
