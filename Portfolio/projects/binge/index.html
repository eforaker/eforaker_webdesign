      <p>Thesis Abstract: My appreciation for mainstream pop culture is genuine, but I am not a passive consumer. Drawing from embodied experience and contemporary feminist theory, I design as a participant, cultural surveyor, and critic. From these vantage points, I binge-watch to discern the tropes of media such as reality TV romance and dead girl shows. My data bingeing leads to a process of archiving, de/recoding, and making visible the algorithm structuring pop culture. “Fantasy” is derived from the Greek phantazein, meaning “to make visible.” In this thesis, I demonstrate that the reality-fantasy relationship is not an either/or. Reality TV challenges this notion directly: it is more fantasy than reality. The line between reality and fantasy is further blurred when real women play fantasy dead girls; The plotline may be fictional but the violence against women is a reality. Like binge-watching, <span class="italic">Binge</span> fully immerses you in my pop culture world through both critique and celebration.</p>
