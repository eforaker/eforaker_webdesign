      <h1>Binge [Fantasy Reality]</h1>
      <p>RISD MFA Thesis Book, 2020.
      <br/> 314 pages, 7x10 inches.</p>
      <p>Design work, research, and writing around the topics of performative femininity, reality TV paradise, Britney Spears, glitter theory, Dead Girls, and more! Includes an in-depth interview with photographer and <span class="italic">New Yorker</span> senior photo-editor Elizabeth Renstrom about her work about teen girls, perfume reviews, and nostalgia. </p>
      <p>Thesis Abstract: My appreciation for mainstream pop culture is genuine, but I am not a passive consumer. Drawing from embodied experience and contemporary feminist theory, I design as a participant, cultural surveyor, and critic. From these vantage points, I binge-watch to discern the tropes of media such as reality TV romance and dead girl shows. My data bingeing leads to a process of archiving, de/recoding, and making visible the algorithm structuring pop culture. “Fantasy” is derived from the Greek phantazein, meaning “to make visible.” In this thesis, I demonstrate that the reality-fantasy relationship is not an either/or. Reality TV challenges this notion directly: it is more fantasy than reality. The line between reality and fantasy is further blurred when real women play fantasy dead girls; The plotline may be fictional but the violence against women is a reality. Like binge-watching, <span class="italic">Binge</span> fully immerses you in my pop culture world through both critique and celebration.</p>

      <p>A digital memorial to/ archive of the 148 women and girls murdered during the first 20 seasons of <span class="italic">Law & Order: SVU</span>. The website’s landing page is a gravestone engraved with one of their names at a time. The user must click on the name to advance through all 148 of the murdered women and girls. The <span class="italic">SVU</span> opening credits “dun dun” plays with each click. This sound is humorous at first, but quickly becomes grating. Fake flowers rest at the bottom of the page as well as links to individual <span class="italic">SVU</span> season pages. Within each season page are gridded screenshots of the Dead Girls killed during that season as well as their names and the titles of the episodes in which they were killed.</p>

      <h1>Guilt Free Pop Culture</h1>
      <p>Website Design and Development, 2018.</p>
      <p>This website playfully proposes that women should not feel guilty about enjoying pop culture. It is designed as a single-page scroll filled with layers of pop culture and junk food floating atop a slowly moving cloudy sky background. Each gif and image is draggable, and the user must sift through these pop culture references in order to read the text beneath. Hovering over the semitransparent bubblegum type makes it become opaque, signaling a link to a relevant external website. There are several Britney Spears gifs scattered throughout the page and, when clicked on, her 1999 hit song &#8220;(You Drive Me) Crazy&#8221; plays.</p> 

      <p>It reads: Pop culture is often compared to junk food; something to feel guilty for consuming. But the term “guilty pleasure” is a defense mechanism used to elevate oneself from the disdain for pop culture. Specifically the disdain for mass media geared towards women. Watching reality TV is considered frivolous and shallow, but religiously following a sports team is perfectly respectable. In the words of writer Jaya Saxena, “When men enjoy something, they elevate it. When women enjoy something, they ruin it.” It’s time to stop feeling guilty about enjoying pop culture. Women are socially conditioned to feel guilty about so many things: what we eat, what we wear, saying “no,” feeling guilty, working too much, etc. Pop culture needn’t add to the list.</p>
