<p>Established in 1846 as Swan Point Cemetary, Swan Point National Park is a meticulously maintained, 200-acre cemetery park located in Providence, Rhode Island. The beautiful grounds offer a peaceful place for visitors to camp, picnic, hike, or visit the dead. Swan Point  is listed on the National Register of Historic Sites, and up until 2035 it was an actively managed, full service cemetery open to people of every faith and heritage. 

When Americaâ€™s National Parks were sold to Jeff Bezos in 2032, a national mandate decreed that all rural cemeteries convert to recreational areas. Global warming has improved the New England winter weather conditions dramatically, making Swan Point an excellent camping destination from late November to  early March. Swimming in the Seekonk River provides respite from the heat of the summer months.
