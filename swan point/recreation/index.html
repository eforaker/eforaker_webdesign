<p>Swan Point National Park has four designated picnic areas with tables, firepits, and bins for recycling or composting. However, visitors are encouraged to picnic anywhere they would like within the park. Many of the tombstones are short and flat, making great tables.  
</p>
<p>Hikihg trails within the park offer scenic views of the Seekonk River. All hikes are rated easy to moderate difficulty. We recommend that hikers wear waterproof shoes since rising water levels have made trail flooding more and more frequent.
