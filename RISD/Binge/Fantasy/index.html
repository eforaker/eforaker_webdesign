	<p style="text-indent: 0;"><i>Oops!... I Did it Again</i> has really aged well. Released by Britney Spears on March 27th, 2000, my favorite song just celebrated its 20th birthday. In the title track off her sophomore album, Britney accidentally leads on a man, yet the tone of her “oops” isn’t exactly remorseful. Britney has the upper hand; she toys with him. </p>
<p><i>Oops!... I Did it Again</i> was the first CD I ever bought. I was seven. Later that year, the cool girls of Fuller Elementary School dressed up in red pleather jumpsuits and prop microphone headsets to go trick-or-treating around Keene.</p>
<p>Those former cool girls are now Millenial women, and they’ll dress up in schoolgirl mini skirts, thigh-high stockings, and pigtail braids to visit <i>Britney Spears The Zone.</i> Opened on January 31st, this 30,000-square-foot experiential pop-up museum in Los Angeles claims to be “The most immersive fan experience ever created -- a life-changing experience that allows you to step into the world of Britney Spears!” The Zone ushers visitors through the re-creation of nine different Britney music videos, album concepts, or live performances.</p>
<p>Like other immersive pop-up museums that have opened the past few years, these rooms are essentially sets made for taking Instagram photos. <i>The Zone</i>’s website displays quintessential Britney backdrops, all eerily empty. A Britney-branded classroom, airplane, and ball pit share a now too familiar vacancy, the same hollowing out of public spaces during the Coronavirus pandemic. Even before LA’s stay-at-home order forced The Zone to close, it sold tickets in 15-minute blocks, limiting the amount of visitors allowed in each room at a time. <i>The Zone</i> was social distancing before it was cool.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the pandemic has taken away <i>The Zone</i> and left us with The Zoom. My favorite Zoom background is Britney Spears holding the massive albino Burmese python during her iconic 2001 VMA performance of <i>Slave 4 U.</i> If I select the I-have-a-green-screen button within Zoom’s Virtual Background settings, I can digitally morph into Britney. My mom wouldn’t let me don a skin-tight red pleather jumpsuit back in the day, but I can seductively pose with a seven-foot snake any day I want to now.</p> 
<p>Pop culture, too, seems to be morphing into Britney, or maybe it's merely revealing its latent Britney DNA. For better or worse, Corona memes have been filling up my Instagram feed. One of the most frequent posts is a new take on the <i>...Hit Me Baby One More Time</i> meme, featuring young Britney in a face mask and the updated lyrics, “My loneliness is saving lives.” In her ability to unify, Britney has increasingly become an emblem for this moment. In a recent <i>New York Times</i> article, “Celebrity Culture is Burning,” Amanda Hess offers, “Spears is an unexpected figure to lead us through quarantine, but a fitting one: She has been held under a conservatorship for 12 years, her movements and finances controlled by her father and overseen by the courts. When she posts about finding community in social captivity, she knows what she’s talking about.”</p>
<p>Britney’s court-ordered conservatorship under her father began shortly after her infamous 2007 meltdown. The image of Britney shaving her own head and subsequently beating a paparazzi’s SUV with an umbrella is forever emblazoned in the public consciousness. No other contemporary celebrity’s breakdown has been memed to the same extent. Britney has been to rehab and placed under involuntary psychiatric holds several times. She has been through a messy divorce, lost custody of her young children, and struggled with drug abuse. To put it succinctly: she has been through some shit. Unlike some other celebrities, I have never felt schadenfreude for Britney. I genuinely want her to succeed. I had a hard time watching her (not really) singing on <i>Carpool Karaoke</i> with James Corden. The truth is that her strength lies in her abilities as a performer, not a singer.</p>
<p>In her stage performances and in her life, Britney is expert at what well-known gender theorist Judith Butler terms <i>performative femininity:
</i> how women speak, dress, move, and present so as to be percieved as a feminine are all performative acts. Britney is both the expression of and captive to the socially constructed ideals and standards placed on women. This week, <i>The New York Times</i> declared that this period of social isolation or quarantine is the time for women to “find joy in letting go” of our collective act. In this article, Ruth La Ferla asserts that “femininity is performance” and questions “what happens when no one is watching?” I have found that it is hard to stop performing when you have been doing it for so many years. I’ve been wearing perfume at home alone and putting on makeup before Zoom calls.</p>
<p>I was twelve years old in 2005 when Britney’s second perfume, <i>Fantasy</i>, was released. I never wore this scent, but I distinctly remember watching the commercial for it. In a sort of ASMR sexy whisper Britney recites her fantasy: “Once upon a time there was a goddess and a hunter. She was beautiful and he couldn’t help himself. There wasn’t a single part of her that he didn’t want to touch. But she was leaving soon on a goddess world tour. So he did something kind of crazy. And they lived happily ever after. Fantasy. Everybody has one.”</p>
<p>In the commercial, Britney gracefully runs barefoot through a heavily-CGI’d forest. It is dark and misty, all aesthetically pleasing jewel tones. Her white-blonde hair against her white dress makes her stand out from the darkness. Leaving a trail of glowing green fairy dust/sparkles, she flees the sexy hunter pursuing her. The commercial intersperses real footage of Britney singing in front of a huge crowd. Back in the forest, she makes direct eye contact with the sexy hunter as he draws his bow. Britney turns to run but he shoots her in the back with a “magic love arrow.” She screams and turns to face him. Britney and her hunter passionately make out with the arrow still lodged in her back.</p>
<p>Fifteen years after the release, <i>Fantasy</i> is still Britney’s best-selling perfume. The scent is described on Macy’s website as a love (lust) story in three stages: 

<i>ENCHANTMENT 
The story begins with an enticing mix of lush red lychee,
 golden quince and exotic kiwi. 
CHASE
A playful tease, laced with a yummy cupcake accord, 
jasmine petals and sexy white chocolate orchid. 
CAPTIVATE
At the end, a spell is cast with a surprising finish of creamy musk, 
enchanted orris root and sensual woods.</i></p>

<p>Curious as to how sensual woods smell, I decided to order a bottle for myself. When it came in the mail, I excitedly unboxed my new perfume. The bulbous fuschia bottle was bigger than expected, roughly the size of a tennis ball, punctured with rhinestone zits. I aimed a single spritz on my wrists and rubbed them together. The aroma was nauseating: kind of like overly-sweet grocery store sugar cookies with the bright blue frosting mixed with a floral-scented bath bomb from Bath & Body Works. I tried to wipe the scent off my wrists with some lemon-scented Clorox disinfectant wipes but it was too late. My whole house reeked of <i>yummy cupcake accord</i> and <i>sensual woods</i>.<p>
<p>The appeal of celebrity perfume is clearly not the scent itself. The somewhat twisted allure lies in spritzing some part of Britney onto my own skin. Like digitally melding with her in Zoom, wearing Fantasy perfume, I am one step closer to becoming Britney. As Elizabeth Renstrom asks in a <i>Basenote Bitch</i> Instagram post, “Who didn’t want to be Britney before, and honestly, after her public meltdown?”</p>
<p>The <i>Fantasy</i> perfume line currently has seventeen variations on the fragrance: <i>Fantasy, Midnight Fantasy, Hidden Fantasy, Circus Fantasy, Fantasy Twist, Island Fantasy, Fantasy: Anniversary Edition, Fantasy: The Nice Remix, Fantasy: The Naughty Remix, Fantasy: Stage Edition, Rocker Femme Fantasy, Fantasy: Renner Edition, Fantasy: Intimate Edition, Maui Fantasy, Fantasy In Bloom, Sunset Fantasy</i>, and <i>Fantasy: Pride Edition</i>. The descriptions of these and other celebrity perfumes conjure up the fantasy woman. She is perfect and impossibly contradictory: delicate, sweet, sensual, vibrant, delightful, fancy, fun, lighthearted, joyful, upbeat, stylish, bold, exciting, wild, rebellious, mesmerizing, dazzling, playful, cool, seductive, smooth, daring, charming, and sparkling. I am exhausted just thinking about her.</p>
<p>Cultivation Theory posits that ideological messages transmitted through popular media heavily influence how we percieve our own reality. In her perfume commercial, when Britney chooses to stay with her sexy predator rather than persue her music career, girls internalize that message. In middle school, I tried to emulate Britney with glittery makeup and low-cut jeans. Before quarantine, I would play my original <i>Oops!... I Did it Again</i> CD in the car for my friends on the way to the studio. Now, as I social distance, my fantasy is to have an ocassion to leave my house. I fanticize about the act of getting ready to go out with friends: Britney singing “I’m not that innocent,” as I spritz my neck with my favorite floral perfume.</p>
