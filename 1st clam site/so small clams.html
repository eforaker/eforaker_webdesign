        <p>After a 51-year-old man in Stuart, Florida, <a href ="http://www.king5.com/article/news/nation-now/crabby-customer-calls-911-twice-about-restaurants-small-clams-got-arrested-for-it/465-ce207c71-8755-4726-b7b7-159b1222ab3d" target="_blank">ordered a meal</a> at a local seafood restaurant, which came with clams he deemed "extremely so small," he did what any normal person would do—he called the police.</p>
        <br />

        <p>According to <a href ="http://www.tcpalm.com/story/news/crime/martin-county/2017/12/21/stuart-man-charged-misusing-911-emergency-line-complain-meal/975434001/" target="_blank">TCPalm</a>, Nelson Agosto was dismayed by the size of the clams in the meal he ordered from Crabby’s Seafood Shack. He first complained to the restaurant, which brought him another order of the allegedly minuscule clams free of charge, but that, apparently, was not enough for the Florida man.</p>
        <br />

        <p>“I called for an officer because I was just speaking to a dispatcher and I was [calling about] my Crabby's seafood. I ordered something, and <strong>it was extremely so small,"</strong> Agosto told the 911 dispatcher, according to audio posted by <a href ="http://www.king5.com/article/news/nation-now/crabby-customer-calls-911-twice-about-restaurants-small-clams-got-arrested-for-it/465-ce207c71-8755-4726-b7b7-159b1222ab3d" target="_blank">K5 News</a>, before the 911 dispatcher interrupted him with a request to call back on the "non-emergency line" and provided him with the number.</p>
        <br />

        <p>"OK, but I want somebody to come," Agosto pleaded.</p>
        <br />

        <p>"Sir, I need you to call that number," the dispatcher told him. "This is 911 for emergencies."</p>
        <br />

        <p>He called back shortly after, telling the dispatcher he tried the non-emergency line, but "couldn't get through."</p>
        <br />

        <p>Not too long after the call, Agosto was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of misusing 911. "He was complaining that the clams he was eating were so small he didn't want to pay for them," Sergeant Brian Bossio, the local police spokesman, told K5 News. "It was an arrest, but the officer did not take the guy to jail."</p>
