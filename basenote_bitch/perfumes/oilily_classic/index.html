				<p>If Wendy Darling had a signature scent, this would be it. Chirpy and adventurous with a hint of pixie dust. This is the fragrance that you wear when blades of grass are still sticking to your knees after playing out in the sun all day. You’ve just graduated from smelling exclusively like apple juice and graham crackers, and you want a little more drama in your life. However, you definitely aren’t trying to leave Neverland right this minute. This perfume is your vision board for growing up.</p> <p><span class="italic">Oilily</span> as a brand is the brainchild of a young Dutch couple in the mid 1960s. Their clothes were unique for pairing bright and playful patterns with utility so kid’s could really play in them. Vintage <span class="italic">Oilily</span> really gives daycare Dries van Noten vibes. With a company whose mission statement includes “there truly is beauty in everything: in the sun that’s shining, in the flourishing flowers that blossom richly to the smile on a child’s face when it gets an ice-cream,” you can expect their perfume will share the same fancifulness.</p> <p>Notes include lime and mandarin orange; middle notes are cyclamen, lily-of-the-valley, red apple, jasmine, melon, peach, plum and raspberry; base notes are vetiver, oakmoss and sandalwood. <span class="italic">In real life you will smell like the inside of a Susan Alexandra bag.</span> Kaleidoscopic and joyful.</p><br/>
