				<p>As the name would suggest, this is the first foray into fragrance by the jewel house Van Cleef & Arpels. Naturally it had to smell both sparkling & opulent, and what better time to achieve that during the aldehydes boom of the 70s? What followed was an OG stealth wealth masterpiece that paired incredibly well with dreams of the aristocracy.</p> <p><span class="italic">First</span> is having another reintroduction as one of Diana, Princess of Wales’ most beloved fragrances. In between notes on his todger, Prince Harry tenderly recalled how scent therapy with <span class="italic">First</span> allowed him to process the death of his mother. In many ways, outside of all the previously claimed scents worn by Spencer—this one really evokes the people’s princess.</p> <p>The perfume itself is effervescent and sophisticated in the top notes, but then the radiant base of oakmoss kicks in and greets you like an old friend. <span class="italic">In real life you will smell like someone who can pull off a tiara while eating a Happy Meal.</span></p><br/>
