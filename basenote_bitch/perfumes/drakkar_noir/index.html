				<p>This has become the shitty striped button down while going out with your bros of cologne, or in other circles the ‘Unknown Pleasures’ t-shirt of colognes. This is the guy that will explain his record collection before he has sex with you. He has a pinky ring and he oversprayed Drakkar Noir between 1990-1993. I don’t mean to come for it completely, this is an iconic aromatic fougere that can still make a person feel fresh when used cautiously. However, because of its popularity in the late 80’s/early 90’s it forever haunts the noses of the innocent many who had to endure this cologne cloud. I understand how it’s ubiquity—the advertising and lore behind it was quite literally ‘You will be a sensuous part viking, part vampire warrior full of strength should you wear this scent.” I’d invest in a bottle too if that was the case. This is also one of the most successful flankers of all time—the original scent ‘Drakkar’ was released a decade prior. Adding ‘Noir’ at the height of 80’s goth is likely no coincidence.</p> <p>Notes for this include rosemary, lavender, basil, lemon verbena, bergamot, coriander, carnation, cinnamon, juniper, jasmine, leather, sandalwood, fir, amber, patchouli, oakmoss, vetiver and cedar. <i>In real life you will smell like Angel from Buffy the Vampire Slayer before he puts it down with Buffy and coincidentally turns into a demon.</i> Forbidden and hot.</p><br/>
