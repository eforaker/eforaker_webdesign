				<p>The Marciano brothers were responsible for so many late 90s icons. They had a knack for defining culture with their Guess Girls, and none were more celebrated & later unfairly mocked than Anna Nicole Smith. This perfume came out right before her untimely death in 2007 at the age of 39.</p> <p>The climate was peak noughties, and our collective obsession with reality TV was rampant. The access to fame felt owed, and we were equally fascinated by the celebrity shame cycle. There could be no better fragrant pairing for the time than <span class="italic">Guess for Women</span>.</p> <p>It was said to be one of Anna’s favorite perfumes, and like her, on first spritz it’s a pink fantasy with top notes of strawberry, apple & bergamot. The floral fruity trail then begins to fade into its deeper heart notes of musk, cedar, amber & oakmoss. <span class="italic">In real life you will smell hard to watch, & harder not to.</span></p><br/>
