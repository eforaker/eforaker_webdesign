				<p>Ah the novelty of Demeter Fragrance Library. Imagine Sephora’s scent section in the late 90s and you would’ve stumbled into the world of <span class="italic">Baby Powder</span>, <span class="italic">Angel Food Cake</span>, and <span class="italic">Dirt</span>. If Felicity was a real NYU student you know she would have worn <span class="italic">Paperback</span> to her shift at the local indie coffee shop Dean & DeLuca (RIP!) That’s the thing, there’s one gross, oddity scent for everyone. If you want to smell like a prepubescent alcoholic, may I suggest <span class="italic">Gin & Tonic</span> combined with <span class="italic">Cotton Candy</span>? Or a deranged toddler combo would be <span class="italic">Play Doh</span> with <span class="italic">Elvira’s Zombie</span>! I’m also just going to throw out this 90s fun fact that Kate Moss reportedly has worn their scent <span class="italic">Dirt</span> for many moons. Of course she has and you can too. They are trying to manipulate your memories with single notes which are unique to their line.</p> <p>There’s no pyramid of top, middle, and base. If you spritz <span class="italic">Funeral Home</span> on you that’s what you’re getting for the next two hours. Their performance is pretty quick so if you hate it you won’t smell like <span class="italic">Beet Root</span> for eternity.</p> <p><span class="italic">Funeral Home’s</span> notes include classic white flowers including lilies, carnations, gladiolus, chrysanthemums with stems and leaves, with a hint of mahogany and oriental carpet. <span class="italic">In real life you’ll smell like a widow with an excellent prenup.</span></p><br/>
