				<p>A first body mist was as sacred an entry into tweendom in the early 2000s as the right saying t-shirt. You needed to declare to the world at large that “This is What a Princess Looks Like,” or the fact that you were “Queen of the Universe.” You could either be “0% Angel,” or, “90% Angel,” and these choices mattered. I wanted to be “50% Naughty, 50% Nice,” but in my heart of hearts I was just 100% awkward.</p> <p>After a final call on the correct statement tee, the mist was next on crucial decisions to prevent social suicide. The safest default for any girl between 12 and 17 was to smell unequivocally like Fun Dip and Sugar Babies. The only choice could be <span class="italic">Body Fantasies Signature Cotton Candy</span> with this rubric. If you wanted to be a high fructose Felicia then this “mist” was your answer. It was also at a price point you could afford after pawning off all of your Breyer Horses in a half-baked yard sale.</p> <p>Notes include cotton candy, sugar cane, strawberry, raspberry, vanilla, and musk. <span class="italic">In real life you will smell like all the candy in the quarter toy machine next to the one you got all these stickers from outside of Savers.</span></p><br/>
