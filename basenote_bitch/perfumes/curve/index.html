				<p>This smells like the nice guy in a bad button down that helped you set up your Razr at the Motorola store before all of our brains melted from the iphone. It also smells like all the boys I never slept with but had a crush on in elementary, middle, and high school. Yes I was a virgin, but I could drive. The guy who wears this now definitely plays a first-person shooter game, but also has a sensitive side and you need to be emotionally stable as fuck to date the guy who wears Curve in his twenties. When it originally came out in 1996 it was first advertised with the tagline ‘Liquid Panty Remover’ in men’s magazines. CHARMING! However, this was for the confused teen who wanted to smell masculine and bust a nut in the naughty nineties. Everyone was in the curve cloud because it’s a pretty generalist cologne and that’s okay. It could have been way worse—a High Karate cloud.</p> <p>It’s a classic fougère with notes of juniper, lavender, sage, bergamot, violet, amber, cedar, etc. <i>In real life you will smell like the character Joey Donner in ‘10 Things I Hate About You’ or a jock walking across the stage at graduation while Green Day's "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)” plays in the background.</i></p><br/>
