				<p>I’m still actively processing my thoughts and feelings about this line almost two decades after it’s release. MTV viewers across the globe watched Jessica Simpson on <span class="italic">Newlyweds</span> throw up during the making of the campaign for her now notorious <span class="italic">Dessert Treats</span> line of edible beauty products. This shit was no Chicken of the Sea! Like many brands at the time, her own was built on selling a hyper sexualized version of herself to market the products. The advertisements feature her and sometimes Nick Lachey testing out the line and licking various body parts of his previously <span class="italic">virginal</span> branded wife. This would all be fine in theory, but the main demographic for the line was your average tween.</p> <p>Cut to my 14th birthday, one of my friends got me the above perfume and some whipped cream moisturizer from the line as a joke (much in the same way we would go to Spencer’s Gifts to purchase edible underwear for the novelty). With no partner in sight until well after high school I was left to lick my own arms later that night. After the cake was consumed and friends trickled out, I put a generous helping up to my right elbow and rubbed it partially in. A nauseous cloud of vanilla and num num floated around me as P!nk’s “Just Like A Pill” softly played in the background. I ate it all while looking at myself in the mirror trying to understand how older girls make this look sexy. I was left with a horrific stomach ache and an accompanying diary entry about never becoming desirable enough to have fake food products eaten off of me. <span class="italic">Dessert Treats</span> was short-lived after the collective cry of yeast infections paired with an uptick in bees following wearers, but I will never forget that first taste of sexual humiliation combined with spun sugar.</p> <p>Notes for <span class="italic">Candy</span> include amber, sugar and vanilla. <span class="italic">In real life you will smell quite literally like Mandy Moore’s hit single “Candy.”</span></p><br/>
