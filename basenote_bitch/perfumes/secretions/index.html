				<p>This is supposed to be one of the worst smelling fragrances ever made. Cum, blood, piss, etc. have all mixed together and come to play in this one. It kind of smells like if the air conditioning at a sperm bank malfunctioned and all the semen flooded out of a window, then slowed to a trickle and dripped onto an iron gate below the bank and rusted it over time from the juices above. Alternatively, it smells like if a full diva cup of blood popped right out of you into a large bucket of chum. Either or!</p> <p>It’s a peak niche and I love it—a scent that is made to bring up memories. This is the real carnal flower! It’s the tears streaming down your face after a hate fuck. It’s your scraped knees as a kid when you took the band aid off too soon and you had a moist wound paired with that undeniable gauze scent. We stink baby—and I think it’s a beautiful ode to that and why we wear fragrances in the first place. Would I wear it in public? Yes. Where? To a scorned lover’s funeral. Maybe to a male pickup artist summit? Who can say! It’s a wonderful scent to wear spitefully.</p> <p>Notes include iodized accord, adrenalin accord, blood accord, milk accord, iris, coconut, sandalwood, etc. <span class="italic">In real life you will smell like a sexy zombie.</span></p><br/>
