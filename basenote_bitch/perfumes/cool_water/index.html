				<p>This is what Abercrombie and J. Crew photoshoot dreams were made of before ‘Fierce’ was a glimmer in Christophe Laudamie’s eye. Above is the ‘For Women’ version; this and the original were both what put aquatics on the fragrance map forever. I’m getting very Patrick Swayze in ‘Point Break,’ vibes mixed in with every dude exiting Gold’s Gym in the 90’s and using this as their shower. That’s the thing with all these fresh fougeres of the time—they were def overused by both your uncle and your first crush. They were at once a reference point for older men in your life, but also a cue for your desire in high school—thus causing irrevocable trauma. ‘Cool Water’ and all of its impersonators are also contentious because they are remarkably uncomplicated fragrances. We are just coming into the September of our Oud years and I’m enjoying this contemplative and moody time devoid of watery vibes. We’ll see how long that lasts before another wave. I hope the new one is instead filled with ambergris, salt, and mystery with less douche.</p> <p>Notes include mint, lavender, geranium, neroli, jasmine, sandalwood, musk, and amber. <i>In real life you’ll smell like if ‘Cucumber Melon’ from Bath and Body Works and Degree Sport had a baby.</i></p><br/>
