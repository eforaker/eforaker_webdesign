				<p>If you’ve had a one night stand with a guy who had a framed ‘Scarface’ poster in his bedroom then you may have seen this iconic 1988 cologne on his dresser. He may or may not have learned how to play Dave Matthews Band “Crash Into Me” on acoustic guitar in college so he could ‘come into you.’ All these details aside, he cares enough to smell baseline masculine and not like a malt liquor-soaked sponge after a rager. He works on his body and drinks Bud Light when not drinking Muscle Milk, and sometimes that can be constipating but that’s okay. The smell of petrol intrigues him because it reminds him of working in his dad’s garage growing up. It is also a key part of the original formulation of this masterpiece and why it may have ended up in his fragrance wardrobe.</p> <p>Other notes include lavender, mandarin orange, hawthorn, nutmeg flower, cedar, bergamot, chamomile and lemon; middle notes are nutmeg, honeysuckle, carnation, sandalwood, violet leaf, jasmine, lily-of-the-valley and cedar; base notes are leather, tonka bean, amber, patchouli, musk and vetiver. The noses behind the myth that has endured for more than thirty years are Maurice Roger and Jean-Louis Sieuzac. <i>In real life you will smell like an ad exec in the late 90’s before he got his hands on Le Labo 33.</i> Interesting for the time but ultimately overpowering.</p><br/>
