				<p>Do you ever pick up a bottle of perfume and say to yourself, “If I had sex in a pew this would be the memory juice of this time?” These are very Season 2 of <span class="italic">Fleabag</span> where she is initially blue-balled by the hot priest while giving confession. I think these are what devotional scents smells like. Kind of incense-y, kind of old wooden benchy—kind of naughty? If you are DTF in the chapel I think these scents are right for you and me. Spray a little holy water to get a little wet. Pay 2 pray, if you will. The range is from Diptyque’s <span class="italic">L’eau Trois</span> Eau De Toilette, January Scent Project’s <span class="italic">Buruvu</span>, House of Matriarch’s <span class="italic">Sex Magic</span> (and literally every other amazing House of Matriarch scent,) and a classic throughback that Iris and Carl Apfel wore throughout their love, Caron’s <span class="italic">Yatagan</span>.</p> <p>As someone who always wanted to be a Catholic school girl but never got the chance and then instead grew up to be a complete fragrance psycho–I have a deep love for these scents. Backstory on the Diptyque, “At the top of Mount Athos, after a long hike, we sought shelter from the burning sun within the walls of a monastery. When we opened the doors, the scent of resinous shrub mingled with the incense and myrrh burned during the service.” Hot.</p><br/>
