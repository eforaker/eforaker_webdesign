				<p>The year is 1995 and you’re about to let Manic Panic in “Vampire Red” get to your head. The inspiration for this mane transformation is one of your most sacred objects, ie, <span class="italic">Sassy Magazine</span>’s April 1992 issue. Each time you fear you’re selling out (which is a constant worry of every Gen Xer with a pulse,) you pull this cover of Kurt and Courtney out. You run your fingers over the grunge icons carefully and move forward applying your authenticity with a hair paste. While the dye is absorbing, you grab your GAP <span class="italic">Dream</span> body mist and spray it all over your exposed, and recently pierced belly button. The infection will TOTALLY go away soon.</p> <p>You begin to smell as periwinkle as the cropped sweater you ripped off from Liv Tyler. Clouds start to appear from behind your vanity, and you realize the blend of <span class="italic">Dream</span> and Basic Red 51 was probably overkill. In your haze, you really became something by the age of 23, all while looking like Angela Chase to boot. When you come to, the smell of <span class="italic">Dream</span> is still in the air, but all that’s left is your cognitive dissonance.</p> <p>The top notes are osmanthus and tangerine; the middle notes are freesia, orange blossom, osmanthus, jasmine, lily-of-the-valley, and violet; base notes are carnation and musk. <span class="italic">In real life, you’ll smell like the dream of the 90s.</span></p><br/>
