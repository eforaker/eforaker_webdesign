				<p>This was one of the best selling male fragrances of the 70s and still smells better to me than half the generic marine <span class="italic">Acqua Di Gio</span> dupes shilled out today. I desperately need aquatic fragrances marketed to men to be over. I blame the movie <span class="italic">Splash</span>, for this obsession with the sea. FIGHT ME! Before the era of ozonic oppression, <span class="italic">Grey Flannel</span> had made its way into countless stockings, dressers, and drugstores over the past several decades since its launch in 1975. The reasonable price tag and extremely wearable composition made it a crucial step in any guy’s beauty regime including a blowout with the Pro 1200 hair dryer finished off with a dab of Brylcreem.</p> <p>Although there is no gender in fragrance, and this one in particular is beautifully unisex, looking through the historical lens it was an unlikely oddball for &#8220;male&#8221; marketed fragrances at the time. That’s because at its heart <span class="italic">Grey Flannel</span> is a beautiful violet scent that is as herbal as it is fresh—which was a far cry from the <span class="italic">Hai Karates</span> of the world. This leads me to believe that people really do want something unique and not to just live in the binary of &#8220;I smell like candy&#8221; or &#8220;I smell like Axe.&#8221; There are standout cheapies like Geoffrey Beene’s creation that show us that time and time again. I highly recommend popping by your local drugstore and getting a bottle today.</span></p> <p>Notes include galbanum, petitgrain, neroli, lemon and bergamot; middle notes are violet, iris, geranium, mimosa, sage, narcissus and rose; base notes are oakmoss, vetiver, cedar, tonka bean and almond. <span class="italic">In real life you’re going to smell like a wool sweater after a rainy afternoon in London.</span> Comforting and green.</p>
