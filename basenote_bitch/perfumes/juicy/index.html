				<p>You cannot reflect on early 2000s fashion without mentioning the iconic Juicy Couture tracksuit. Love or hate these plushy, velour, proto-athleisure uniforms—they still graced some of the most talked about tushies at the turn of the century. Now we don’t even bat a lash at dropping coin on fancy jammies that aren’t even as cute and don’t come with Swarovski crystals in motherfuckin’ Old English font. I highly recommend re-exploring them become little whispers of a wedgie in Paris Hilton’s derriere while she attempts farm work on <span class="italic">The Simple Life.</span> <p>Juicy was pretty much at peak popularity when they released their namesake fragrance in 2006, and then what followed was the wildly successful <span class="italic">Viva La Juicy.</span> You already know it’s a FLIRTY and FRUITY floral gourmand fragrance. The girl who wears this may or may not have a Von Dutch accessory she wears aspirationally like the celebrities who aspired to look like truckers (cue <span class="italic">Zoolander</span> Derelicte fashion line.) She has tried the 21 Day Beachbody Fix at least a 100 times, but this time will be the charm. When she steps out into the world this will be her signature scent and there will be a Fendi Baguette bag in the mix.</p> <p>Notes include mandarin orange and wild berries; middle notes are honeysuckle, gardenia and jasmine; base notes are caramel, vanilla, praline, amber and sandalwood. <span class="italic">In real life you will smell like a blend of freshly Chi flat ironed hair paired with a Lancome’s Juicy Tube.</span></p>
