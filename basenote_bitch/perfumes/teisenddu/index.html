				<p>This fragrance is one of those gourmands that make me turn into a zombie for my own flesh. I don’t have a better way of expressing how wonderfully delicious, all at once fresh, yet never cloyingly sweet it is. Teisenddu was created by the first woman-owned niche fragrance house from Argentina, and this particular fragrance is inspired by a dish out of Patagonia. Welsh emigrants hoping to establish settlements arrived in Puerto Madryn with a reinvented dessert that could be kept easily for long periods of time—ie. the indestructible fruit cake. ‘Torta Negra’ many generations later is still a beloved dessert in the region and has been commemorated in this juice. Something that specific could only yield a very* unforgettable perfume and this truly is. The minute I put a sample on my arm I could not stop sniffing—and then we all know how obsession sets in. What I find so unique is the beautiful spice up front that mixes with juniper and really gives you a sense of the landscape it was created in. All of this moves into a wamm, cozy tea room where you know some cake is about to go down. I can’t overstate that it is a wonderful gourmand, but not one that will leave you feeling like you at an entire log of panettone.</p> <p>Notes include bitter orange, rum, juniper, nutmeg, mimosa, dark sugar crystals, and leather. <i>In real life you’re going to smell like eating a leg off a gingerbread man and chasing it with a spiced rum cocktail.</i> All at once festive and naughty.</p><br/>
