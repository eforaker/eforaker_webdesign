				<p>This was the OG ‘most expensive’ fragrance in the world at the time of its conception. Granted it nearly kicked off The Great Depression when it became available in 1930 so ANYTHING could have been ‘the most expensive.’ However, the luxurious story transcends because of the raw materials used to produce it. The juice and the myth give me very Mid-Atlantic accent vibes. Ie. used to be seen as upwardly mobile while being slightly ridiculous. Ridiculous in the best way, though! These bottles were casually stuffed with the essence of 28 dozen roses and 10,600 jasmine flowers making it one of those blends to go down in perfume history for its floral grandeur. Interestingly enough another historically bitchy scent relative, Chanel No. 5,  is stuffed with the souls of a thousand jasmine flowers and twelve Pegomas roses. They both land completely differently, but could be worn by the same talkies. ‘Joy’ was second best selling perfume at the time following No.5. When you apply this you will most definitely transform into Eliza Dolittle after her elocution lessons.</p> <p>Notes include tuberose, rose, ylang-ylang, aldehydes, pear, green notes, jasmine, musk, sandalwood, and civet. <i>In real life you’ll smell like a literal grande dame.</i></p><br/>
