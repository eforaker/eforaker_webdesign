				<p>Ah, the sharp beauty that if Vetiver! Many people judge a fragrance line on how they handle their interpretation of this note. That can seem daunting as there’s truly endless possibilities. You have your green vetivers, your dry, your citrus, your flowery, your powdery, your balsamic, your earthy, your smoky, your leathery, your boozey, and your sweet—I could go on for fear of boring you. There’s also the differences between where you source this beautiful grass that can truly change how a perfume ends up smelling. Today I’m bringing you a couple interpretations from Orris Perfumery in LA. Orris is a niche fragrance store that features handcrafted scents from brands exclusively founded or based in California. Most, if not all of their fragrances are completely natural. I find because of this Vetiver shines in completely different ways across the different lines they carry.</p> <p>Luce Del Sole by Litoralle is a gorgeous part salty and citrusy vetiver fragrance. It’s an excellent choice for this current heat wave because it feels like you're squeezing a lemon rind in the air on the deck of a boat bobbing along the Amalfi Coast. DOESN’T THAT SOUND NICE?Troupe by Capsule Parfums would be the equivalent of the drink you should be having on said boat. With notes of tequila blanco and orange mixed in–it’s an incredibly smoky, indulgent freshy. Stay with me, but the final vetiver scent in this lineup smells like what happens when you dock and get your bare feet on land. Vetiveria by Fiele Fragrances is both bizarre and addictive. On me it dries down to a beautiful skin scent that mostly reads as quite literally a roll in the hay. It’s a sweet, earthy accompaniment to the Haitian Vetiver sourced for this rich scent. All can be found at Orris and I highly encourage you to read about some of the other collections they feature.</p><br/>
