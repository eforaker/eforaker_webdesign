				<p>Splashing onto the drugstore circuit of 1977, <span class="italic">Babe</span> has become somewhat of a perfume urban legend. Some say it’s because it carved the path for the fruity florals of now due to the unusual raspberry note for the time. Others say for the iconic Margaux Hemingway advertisements that made you want to go tubing down a river donning a glamorous chartreuse ball gown.</p> <p>Either way, this is one of those affordable pieces of opulence for the teen girl who shopped at Bradlees. She’s definitely also sporting Wella Balsam shampoo and a fresh pair of clogs. Her lips are so freshly lacquered in Bonne Bell gloss you can nearly make out your reflection. She’s clompin to the mailbox to drop off her college applications because she’s cute but not kept. Remember that <span class="italic">Babe</span> falls in the wake of Revlon’s 1973 classic, <span class="italic">Charlie</span>, and is in the women’s liberation roundup of fragrances.</p> <p>Notes (there are reportedly 118) include aldehydes, raspberry, bergamot, jasmine, hyacinth, ylang-ylang, lily of the valley, honey, rose, orris root, carnation, citrus, coriander, oak moss, amber, vetiver, musk and celery seed. <span class="italic">In real life you will smell like the fragrance strip insert in</span> Ms. Magazine.</p><br/>

				The year is 1998 and you have just mapped out your copy of the TV Guide like an obsession wall in a David Fincher movie. You will be present for all airtime involving Dawson and Pacey for the next two weeks when not in school. Your only food will be the Happy Meals you’ve bribed your friends to pick up for you, because you also need to maintain your competitive Teenie Beanie Baby collection. They could be worth something someday! In between reruns of the sacred creek, you try to map out your destiny with a Cootie Catcher. You picture yourself in that iconic New England town of Capeside, Massachusetts, and think about what Joey would be wearing. It’s so obvious it would be Juniper Breeze, aka, the absolute height of purity and effortlessness. You apply the splash underneath your slap bracelet and are instantly transported to that dock. Notes include Juniper, Mountain Air, Aldehydes, Green Apple and Pineapple; middle notes are Jasmine and Ylang-Ylang; base notes are Precious Woods and Musk. In real life you will smell like one of those dusty-ass gel candles you get at a seaside tchotchke shop and never burn.
