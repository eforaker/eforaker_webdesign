    This project began with a visit to the Providence Public Library special collections. Given the prompt to find one artifact as source material, I chose The Buccaneers of America because I thought the illustration of a man eating a heart was insane. Wwe only had a limited amount of time with our source material, but I found a opy of the book online and read the entire text. I tried to compare the sensationalizing tone of the writing to something contemporary and was reminded of gossip magazines. I then pulled quotes directly from the book and applied the aesthetics of magazines such as People, Ok!, and Star to create my own publication. I included real advertisements for products I know pirates would enjoy, and printed a bunch of copies on glossy paper. After designing Blimey!, I translated the content into a digital platform by coding a website called Treachery Tally, a news website for pirates, in the the vein of the Drudge Report.
