    When Hillary lost the 2016 election, I was very upset and needed to channel my disappointment into something positive. My mother sent me the NYT article and we collaborated to design a SMASH THE GLASS tote bag for friends and family. We had about 50 printed and sent out all over the country. Two years later at RISD, I had an assignment to create a typography identity for anything I wanted. I decided to redesign the SMASH THE GLASS tote and create a new identity for the movement. I went through many iterations for the logotype, trying to determine how illustrative it should be. I then incorporated phrases and experimented with "smashing" them apart. The final identity system is direct and empowering.
