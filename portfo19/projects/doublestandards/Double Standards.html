The Double Standards Manual highlights and examines the sexist double standards that I and many other children experienced while growing up. Although double standards don’t disappear after adolescence, I have focused on my childhood specifically because those were the years when these gender-based double standards were most strictly imposed (both explicitly and subconsciously). 

The notion of strict brand identity guidelines as the be all end all is inherently flawed because it denies the reality of an unpredictable and evolving world. Flexibility and the ability to adapt are needed to create good design on a case-to-case basis. Similarly, strict gender roles limit one’s potential. 

In the second half of this manual, I have identified logotypes of toys, products, and TV shows I grew up with. As I built this collection, patterns of color, typography, and graphic elements emerged, separating products marketed for boys versus girls. As expected, pink was widespread in female gendered logotypes and red was dominant in male gendered logotypes. To round out my study of double standards, I emphasized stereotypes by applying the generic female graphic qualities to male gendered logotypes, and vice versa.
