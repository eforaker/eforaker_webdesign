I don’t keep up with the Joneses;
<br/>If it doesn’t make me money,
<br/>I'm an independent woman,
<br/>People call me a gold digger,
<br/>When I walk into the room,
<br/>I have arrived,
<br/>Don't call it a comeback,
<br/>Call me a bad server,
<br/>Music may be my passion,
<br/>I have fame and fortune,
<br/>I may be small,
<br/>Don’t mess with the boss,
<br/>Now that I’ve got my Ace,
<br/>My business is beauty,
<br/>Beauty fades,
<br/>I know how to work it,
<br/>I’m the ultimate Southern belle,
<br/>A true southern belle knows her worth,
<br/>Don't come for me,
<br/>People get exhausted trying to figure me out,
<br/>People may think they have me figured out,
<br/>People say I have a picture perfect life,
<br/>I'm about to give you life,
<br/>Friends come and go,
<br/>I'm too blessed to be stressed,
<br/>Faith, family and career --
<br/>I am still standing,
<br/>I may be an open book,
<br/>10 years in the game,
<br/>I like things that are elegant and sophisticated,
<br/>I'm not a trophy wife,
<br/>When life gets messy,
<br/>I came home to Dallas to shine my light,
<br/>I'm the girl next door,
<br/>You don't mess with Texas,
<br/>I married into money,
<br/>I was a Cowboys cheerleader,
<br/>I cheered for the Cowboys,
<br/>This isn't my first rodeo,
<br/>I started from the Dallas dynasty,
<br/>The word on the street is,
<br/>If you can't handle me being the word on the street,
<br/>I've played by Potomac rules,
<br/>Karma is a bitch, but luckily,
<br/>You may say I cause trouble,
<br/>I don't have a cookie cutter life,
<br/>Life has its ups and downs,
<br/>Don't let the green eyes fool you,
<br/>The shorter my hair,
<br/>Potomac put me on a pedestal,
<br/>Baby don't believe what you hear,
<br/>You can try to tear me down,
<br/>If I don't know who you are,
<br/>Why cry over spilled milk,
<br/>I maybe rough around the edges,
<br/>You'll never put me in a box,
<br/>Life is a pageant,
<br/>Now that I’m marrying my prince,
<br/>It may look like I have it all,
<br/>I finally found my voice,
<br/>Know your friends,
<br/>Having it all is easy,
<br/>Money is what I have,
<br/>I was a child star,
<br/>Everybody loves a comeback story,
<br/>I’ve been rich and I’ve been famous,
<br/>In a town full of phonies,
<br/>I'm not the richest girl in Beverly Hills,
<br/>Planes and yachts are nice,
<br/>In Beverly Hills you can be anything,
<br/>I'm an expert on luxury,
<br/>In this town, fame and money come and go,
<br/>In Beverly Hills,
<br/>In Beverly Hills it's who you know,
<br/>Life isn’t all diamonds and rosé,
<br/>Life is a sexy little dance,
<br/>Throw me to the wolves and I shall return,
<br/>I’m passionate about dogs,
<br/>You can stab me in the back,
<br/>Money doesn’t give you class,
<br/>I like to have fun,
<br/>Don’t tell me you’re my friend,
<br/>Character isn’t what you have,
<br/>Fake friends believe rumors,
<br/>In my world,
<br/>I’m not a bitch,
<br/>I may be an actress,
<br/>I speak no evil,
<br/>You’ve heard a lot about me,
<br/>My advice to you:
<br/>I don't have to buy it,
<br/>In the game of life
<br/>Don't hate the game,
<br/>I’m an enigma,
<br/>I may be two people,
<br/>Some people call me cold,
<br/>When you've traveled the world,
<br/>I believe in an excess of everything…
<br/>In business and in life,
<br/>Having the best isn't important to me,
<br/>I’m not afraid of hard work,
<br/>I deserve only the best...
<br/>I want the power and the money,
<br/>I love my family, I love my work,
<br/>I make my own money,
<br/>My tank is full,
<br/>I’m my own boss,
<br/>I make my own rules,
<br/>I am the OG of the O.C.;
<br/>Before you judge me,
<br/>I go big or go home,
<br/>The fun bus is leaving and, this time,
<br/>It's just money,
<br/>I love money,
<br/>It doesn't matter what happens in life,
<br/>Money is a girl’s best friend,
<br/>I still get pampered,
<br/>No matter how much money you have,
<br/>I'm not the new girl anymore,
<br/>Housewives come younger,
<br/>I'm done being a trophy wife,
<br/>I call the shots in my life now,
<br/>I'm not getting older,
<br/>Boldness comes at a cost,
<br/>My faith is strong,
<br/>I'm pint sized, baptized,
<br/>I'm still the hottest housewife in Orange County,
<br/>I love the bling, I love the jewelry,
<br/>Don't call me a princess,
<br/>When the going gets tough,
<br/>It's not about how much money you have,
<br/>God is my savior, my husband is my king,
<br/>I thank God every day for my life,
<br/>Soccer moms drive mini vans,
<br/>I may be married to a plastic surgeon,
<br/>Whoever said blondes have more fun,
<br/>You may think I have it all,
<br/>No one's life is perfect,
<br/>If at first you don't succeed,
<br/>You only live once, but if you work it right,
<br/>If you can't take my sparkle,
<br/>The O.C. is full of secrets,
<br/>When life gives you lemons,
<br/>Karma's a bitch,
<br/>The truth is organic,
<br/>Now that I'm in the O.C.,
<br/>In the game of life,
<br/>I can handle a baby,
<br/>I don't throw parties,
<br/>If I want your opinion,
<br/>Call animal control,
<br/>I'm living the American dream,
<br/>When you come from humble beginnings,
<br/>I speak the truth,
<br/>People make fun of Jersey girls,
<br/>I'm a Jersey girl,
<br/>When times get tough,
<br/>Haters are gonna hate,
<br/>I used to flip tables,
<br/>If you're not about the namaste,
<br/>These days, I don't throw punches...
<br/>Everyone likes to have nice things,
<br/>I am a Vegas girl,
<br/>I've faced my share of challenges,
<br/>Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice,
<br/>If you're gonna mess with my family,
<br/>Life is about change,
<br/>Life is short,
<br/>Love me or hate me,
<br/>If you think I'm a bitch,
<br/>I never throw the first punch,
<br/>Sexy life, loyal wife,
<br/>I always act like a lady,
<br/>Don't try to bully me,
<br/>People say that I'm sweet, but I'm tough,
<br/>We're old school,
<br/>If you can't take the heat,
<br/>You’re not seeing double,
<br/>I’m a survivor,
<br/>Look up loyalty in the dictionary,
<br/>I may put up a tough front,
<br/>My motto is know your worth,
<br/>I bring the power,
<br/>I can make you laugh or make you cry...
<br/>I'm obsessed with family, traditions,
<br/>I have four kids, two degrees,
<br/>To a certain group of people in New York,
<br/>I've always had opinions,
<br/>When people tell me I'm fake,
<br/>I'm not a Housewife,
<br/>If you can't handle the truth,
<br/>If you're going to take a shot at this B,
<br/>When life gives me limes,
<br/>I may be a princess,
<br/>If you're going to talk about me behind my back,
<br/>In the politics of friendship,
<br/>In the marathon of life,
<br/>Diamonds aren't a girl's best friend;
<br/>I tell it like it is,
<br/>I have a big heart,
<br/>If you've got a problem with me,
<br/>A true New Yorker never backs down,
<br/>Good or bad,
<br/>I've created a great life,
<br/>I'm living the American Dream,
<br/>I may not be the sharpest tool in the shed,
<br/>I thought I had it good before,
<br/>To some people,
<br/>One should know...
<br/>I like making my own money,
<br/>If people can't handle the truth,
<br/>Get the Pinot ready,
<br/>I know I'm a piece of work, but now,
<br/>Like a fine wine,
<br/>Age is an issue of mind over matter: If you don't mind,
<br/>My yacht may have sailed,
<br/>If being Sonja is so wrong,
<br/>People call me over-the-top,
<br/>Game, set,
<br/>Come on,
<br/>A good set of lashes can fix anything,

  <div id="right">
I am the Joneses.
<br/>I don’t do it.
<br/>doing it for myself.
<br/>but they just want what I have.
<br/>I own it.
<br/>and the spotlight is on me, honey.
<br/>call it a takeover!
<br/>because I always spill the tea!
<br/>but family is forever.
<br/>and I've earned it.
<br/>but my empire keeps on growing.
<br/>'cuz you might get fired.
<br/>I've got a full house. 
<br/>and I'm the boss.
<br/>class is forever.
<br/>and be seen.
<br/>I get what I want.
<br/>and I am priceless.
<br/>unless I twirl for you.
<br/>and I just let them.
<br/>but I am always the wild card.
<br/>and I do.
<br/>so stay out of my way!
<br/>but family is forever.
<br/>and too sexy to be thirsty.
<br/>those are the facts of my life.
<br/>and I am making my own rules.
<br/>but that does not mean I am easily read.
<br/>and I'm still the tastiest peach in Atlanta!
<br/>just like me.
<br/>I'm a lifetime achievement award.
<br/>just build a bigger closet.
<br/>not to fight.
<br/>if you live in a big old mansion.
<br/>and you don't mess with me.
<br/>but family is my fortune.
<br/>but in Dallas I'm never on the sidelines.
<br/>so I never get played.
<br/>so I'm not taking your bull.
<br/>but I’ll finish with my own empire.
<br/>that I'm the word on the street.
<br/>then stop listening.
<br/>now it's time to play by my own.
<br/>I'm on her good side.
<br/>but I say I keep things interesting.
<br/>and I'm not apologizing for it.
<br/>but my game is on the rebound.
<br/>I'm as real as they come.
<br/>the shorter my patience.
<br/>and the view is spectacular.
<br/>the grand dame still holds center court.
<br/>but the Grand Dame never crumbles.
<br/>then you're not worth knowing.
<br/>when you can laugh over champagne.
<br/>but baby, so are diamonds.
<br/>because I'm the whole darn package.
<br/>and I'm in it to win it.
<br/>this sleeping beauty is woke!
<br/>but I want more.
<br/>and I'm not afraid to use it.
<br/>show your enemies the door.
<br/>if you're willing to work for it.
<br/>not who I am.
<br/>but now my most important role is being a mother.
<br/>especially starring me.
<br/>but happiness beats them both.
<br/>I'm not afraid to be me.
<br/>but I am the luckiest.
<br/>but my happiness starts at home.
<br/>but it’s most important to be yourself.
<br/>and I can always spot a fake.
<br/>but friends should not.
<br/>the truth always has a way of rising to the top.
<br/>and I know everyone.
<br/>but it should be.
<br/>and I like to take the lead.
<br/>leading the pack.
<br/>just not crazy about bitches.
<br/>but whilst you’re there, kiss my ass.
<br/>it just gives you money.
<br/>but I don’t play games.
<br/>act like one.
<br/>it’s who you are.
<br/>real friends believe in you.
<br/>money doesn’t talk, it swears.
<br/>but I’ve played one on TV.
<br/>but that doesn’t mean I’ll stick to your script.
<br/>but I see and hear everything.
<br/>but it’s only true when it comes from my lips.
<br/>don't hustle the hustler.
<br/>‘cause I already own it.
<br/>it’s Rinna take all.
<br/>just marry a player.
<br/>wrapped in a riddle, and cash.
<br/>but I'm not two-faced.
<br/>but that's not ice. It's diamonds.
<br/>you can speak in any accent you want.
<br/>except moderation.
<br/>I wear many hats… and hairstyles.
<br/>but being my best is.
<br/>but I’ll never do your dirty work.
<br/>I'm worth it!
<br/>and I want them both.
<br/>I love my life.
<br/>and I make my own rules.
<br/>and I'm driving into my future.
<br/>and it’s time for a raise.
<br/>so don't expect me to follow yours.
<br/>everyone else is just a copy.
<br/>you better be perfect.
<br/>and I am not going home.
<br/>I'm in the driver's seat.
<br/>you can't take it with you.
<br/>and now I'm loving life.
<br/>I do it my way.
<br/>and I love friends.
<br/>I still get treated like a princess. I deserve it.
<br/>you can always rely on others.
<br/>so watch out.
<br/>but they don't come hotter.
<br/>freedom only makes me hotter.
<br/>and I have good aim.
<br/>I'm just getting bolder.
<br/>and I'm willing to pay.
<br/>and my ass isn't bad either.
<br/>and highly prized.
<br/>and, the toughest, too.
<br/>I love it all.
<br/>call me the boss.
<br/>I just get stronger and stronger.
<br/>it's about how good you look spending it.
<br/>and my body? It's sinful.
<br/>and you would, too.
<br/>but this girl drives a Bentley.
<br/>but I'm 98 percent real.
<br/>hasn't met me.
<br/>but I'm just getting started.
<br/>but mine is pretty close.
<br/>try it my way.
<br/>once is enough.
<br/>then stay off my rainbow.
<br/>but I have nothing to hide.
<br/>put nine in a bowl!
<br/>so I don't have to be one.
<br/>but lies are just artificial.
<br/>it's a whole new ball game.
<br/>I choose my team wisely.
<br/>and women who act like one.
<br/>I am the party.
<br/>I'll give it to you.
<br/>cuz there's a cougar on the loose in the OC.
<br/>one sports car at a time.
<br/>you count your blessings...one diamond at a time.
<br/>even if it sounds funny when I say it.
<br/>but I think they're just jealous.
<br/>no one can knock me down.
<br/>you learn who your real friends are.
<br/>but I just love, love, love.
<br/>now I'm turning them.
<br/>then get the hell out of my way.
<br/>I roll with them.
<br/>but I'm not one to brag about it.
<br/>I will call your bluff.
<br/>but I'm tougher than I look.
<br/>you better run.
<br/>you’re messing with me.
<br/>sometimes you just have to roll with the punches.
<br/>I have no time for drama.
<br/>I always speak the truth.
<br/>then bring it on.
<br/>but I’m always a knockout.
<br/>take a page from my book.
<br/>but now I think like a boss.
<br/>because I'm a boss.
<br/>so don't cross me.
<br/>we believe in respect.
<br/>get out of my kitchen.
<br/>you’re seeing trouble!
<br/>no one is bringing me down.
<br/>and you'll find my face.
<br/>but I'll never leave you behind.
<br/>leave the rest to your plastic surgeon.
<br/>the pigtails and the party.
<br/>your choice.
<br/>and Chanel.
<br/>and one kickass life.
<br/>status is everything.
<br/>but now people know it.
<br/>I know they're just pulling my leg.
<br/>but I am real.
<br/>you can't handle me.
<br/>you better not miss.
<br/>I make margaritas.
<br/>but I'm definitely not a drama queen.
<br/>at least check out my great ass.
<br/>I win the popular vote.
<br/>loyalty is everything.
<br/>martinis are!
<br/>but I always make it nice.
<br/>but little patience.
<br/>it's your problem.
<br/>and I'm no exception. Holla!
<br/>I know who I am and I own it.
<br/>and I love living it.
<br/>one mistake at a time.
<br/>but I'm pretty!
<br/>but I'm just getting started.
<br/>living elegantly just comes naturally.
<br/>never count out the Countess.
<br/>I find that an aphrodisiac.
<br/>it's really not my problem.
<br/>because it's Turtle Time!
<br/>I'm a work in progress.
<br/>I just get better with time.
<br/>it doesn't matter!
<br/>but my ship is comin' in.
<br/>why does it feel so right?
<br/>but lately I prefer being a bottom.
<br/>now I need a match.
<br/>why cook when I can order room service?!
<br/>even a mugshot.
